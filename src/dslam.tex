\label{sec:dslam}
As illustraded in \Cref{fig:sysframe} there are tow main inter-robot components in DSLAM system: 1) place recognition and matching. 2) inter-robot relative pose (RelPose) estimation. In this section we implement these components both based on submaps.

\subsection{Submap-Based Place Recognition}
The key problem of place recognition is to extrct discriminative feature vector from 2D submap.

\subsection{Submap-Based RelPose Estimation}
% Because submap contains the position of the map at the single-robot trajectory, the RelPose of two robots can be estimated by calculating the pose of two submaps in the same scene, which is well defined as map registration.

We extract image-based feature from submap and perform coarse registration. After that, we convert the submap to the point cloud and refine the registration result.
