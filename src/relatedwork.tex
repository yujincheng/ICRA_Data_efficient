\subsection{Inter-robot Loop Closure Detection}
Inter-robot loop closure detection, or place recognition, aligns the trajectories of different robots, based on the sensor frames in the same place. 
It is a common way to generate and compare descriptors to find out the potential loop closure.
For vision-based loop closure detection, there are works to extract feature from input image, such as ORB feature\cite{Mur-Artal:2017281} and SIFT feature \cite{lowe2004distinctive} and use some aggregation method to compact the feature into vectors, such as Bag-of-Word \cite{jegou2011aggregating} and VLAD \cite{tolias2013aggregate}.
Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNN) improve the perfomance of visual place recognition in accuracy and robustnesss, sucn as NetVLAD \cite{arandjelovic2016netvlad} and GeM \cite{radenovic2018fine}.
Different from the rich feature of images, laser scan, especially 2D laser scan, is lack of information. Above image-based algorithms cannot directly applied to the laser sensors, even on the  2D map constructed from laser.
\cite{ribenren1} and \cite{ribenren2} design feature extract method for 2D map. 
However, these method are designed for map registration, yet not applicable for place recognition since the feature is not discriminative.
Recently, some works use neural networks to process laser scan or point cloud, such as PointNet \cite{qi2017pointnet} and PointNetVLAD \cite{angelina2018pointnetvlad}. However, these methods are designed for 3D point clouds and are not suitable for 2D scenes that lack information.
It is still a challenging task to do the place recognition on 2D data, such as 2D scan and 2D map.

\subsection{RelPose Estimation}
Map registration, which is used to calculate the transform (translation and rotation) between two maps belonging to the same place, is the key component of RelPose estimation.
